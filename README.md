### Hi there 👋

👨‍💻 I am a **freelance web developer** with 20+ years of experience developing web applications used worldwide. As a generalist-developer trained in systems analysis, I spent over a decade coding applications before leading development teams. Recently, I refocused my career to return to **my first love: hands-on coding work.**

📅 With 10+ years of experience in IT functional / business analysis and three years as a SCRUM product owner, I can aim for the right goal with minimal structure that works.

🔭 I’m currently working on:
- Firebase Functions / Firestore backend for an App generating therapeutic playlists for people with Alzheimer.
- Node.js / MySQL / Firestore / FCM backend for an App that monitors and sends push notifications of status changes in mail servers for clients of an IaaS company.
- Next.js / Bootstrap / Hygraph headless CMS static + dynamic website for a network of NGOs organizing community nodes to provide early response to stranded whales and other cetaceans.
- Next.js / Bootstrap static site for a company providing consulting services for impact investors.

🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning in Python (and everything else that's constantly changing, as we all do!)

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects with social or environmental impact (particularly 🌊 ocean-related!)
